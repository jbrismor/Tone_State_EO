# Project Explanation

**Note:** Further analysis is done outside of this project. To look at the results, please contact us.

This project aims to study the differences in tone on State Election Officials social media accounts. To do so, it uses two methodologies.

1. **Clustering**: This methodology is used to cluster the social media posts of the State Election Officials into groups based on their tone. We do so using different methods, comparing them, and also using different features like party affiliation or battleground status.
2. **Word Counts**: This methodology is used to first classify the type of words using POS tagging, hand-picking the potential biased words from the following word types: adjectives, nouns, auxiliary verbs, verbs, pronouns, and others, andf then looking for differences in use based on the same features utilized for clustering.

This repository does not comment on the results of the analysis, but rather provides the code and data used to perform the analysis of the two methodologies mentioned above.
